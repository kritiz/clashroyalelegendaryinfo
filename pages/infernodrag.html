			<B><I>This card has been on a great rise. His popularity has increased by a great amount. And to be honest this card is pretty balanced. IN the current P.E.K.K.A. and Mega Knight meta he does a great job at countering them but is weak against hogs and eWiz</B></I>.

		<div>
			<B><I>He is great at killing tanks especially if you are able to distract/kill the support. The problem is that it can’t kill fast medium HP win conditions like Hog Rider and Battle Ram and cannot kill Siege win conditions unless you use a Mini Tank</B></I>.

			<B><I>If you build a deck with right cards he is very good</B></I>.

		<div>
			<B><I>A main point to consider is that like Sparky, this card is better on defense than on offense</B></I>.
