		<div>
			<B><I>You can’t say that Ice Wizard was buffed as it also simultaneously nerfed by making his hit speed slower. Rather, Supercell re-balanced this card as it has same HP and almost same DPS, but the 10% damage increase turned the whole thing around</B></I>.

		<div>
			<B><I>Now being able to one-shot Skeletons and Bats as well as 3 shot Minions and Archers he has become a better defensive-swarm clearing option</B></I>.
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>He surprisingly found place in the siege archetype along with X-bow. It also has given rise to a better defensive Miner Poison cycle decks. Being better at countering at Graveyard now, this card is just too versatile yet not OP</B></I>.
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>However, this Snowbow deck quickly lost its popularity as the meta transformed into a P.E.K.K..A. and MK meta which are both hard counter to X-bow. Other than this Ice Wiz sees usage, but eWiz is a better support to be honest</B></I>.
