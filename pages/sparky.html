			<B><I>I hate giving her and seeing her at the last spot again and again. For some reason, Supercell hasn’t buffed her for some reason which is pretty unfair.</B></I>

			<B><I>Sparky is basically a High-risk High-reward card. What this means is that she can be countered very easily and can give opponent good advantage making her a risky choice but her high damage of 1300 at Tournament Standards (Highest Damage per hit) makes her each hit highly rewarding.</B></I>

		<div>
			<B><I>As people have recently started to realize, Sparky is better as a threat card and defensive card (when couple with Tornado) than a Win-Condition. She is best used with Giant, especially in Spell-Bait archetype.</B></I>
		</div>

		<div>
			<B><I>A balance change I suggest is to decrease her cost to 5 elixir, decrease hit speed to 4 seconds and increase damage to 1400. These changes make rocketing her a negative trade, gives her faster recharge, more damage resulting in higher DPS and altogether making her better.</B></I>

		<div>
			<B><I>The release of Mega Knight just added another fair counter to Sparky. He is just too tanky for her to kill him. Lets pray that she receives a buff soon.</B></I>
