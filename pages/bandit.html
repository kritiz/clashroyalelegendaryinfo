			<B><I>Since the nerf of Battle Ram and Night Witch, the phantom combo has starting to die out. Bandit’s usage has started to decline now since her strongest archetype, Bridge Spam, isn’t the meta anymore</B></I>.

		<div>
			<B><I>On the other hand, I believe that this will result in more variety of Bandit decks and not just Bridge Spam. Bandit can be used in Bridge Spam, Control as well as Beatdown (as a glass cannon). Her dash mechanic is pretty unique making her threatening and invulnerable</B></I>.

			<B><I>Her dash range of 4-6 tiles makes her a great card to take care of less-than-average HP troops like Princess and Dart Goblin pretty quickly. She gives most value when her dash is utilized to its maximum</B></I>.

			<B><I>With the release of MK and the start of the P.E.K.K.A. meta, Bandit has become very strong once again as she has a great synergy with both of these tanky cards. She is also strong right now along with Hog Rider for fast paced offenses</B></I>.
