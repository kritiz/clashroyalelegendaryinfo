			<B><I>This card has taken a big drop on the list. But at last she is finally balanced, not OP anymore</B></I>.
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>After nerf, she now fits only in one archetype i.e. Beatdown extremely well while doing average in other archetypes which totally unlike before where she was a Jack of all Trades</B></I>.
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>In beatdown, she is strong because the bats can snow ball behind a tank and can deal tons of damage</B></I>.
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>Killing her will still spawn 2 more bats along with the bats already present making her deadly</B></I>.
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>Night Witch is actually a great counter to MK on defense, killing him alone due to her Bat Spawn without any hit and +3 elixir trade. This has made her a good choice again</B></I>.
