			<B><I>This gal is a pretty balanced card but currently not that versatile.</B></I>
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>She has the longest range of any troop in the game making her a great defensive option.  She is pretty strong in Spell-bait archetype acting as Log, Arrow, Fireball and Poison bait as well as making a great swarm clearer and chip damager. But other than this, she is only good in Hog, Miner and Mortar cycle decks.</B></I>
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>Other support troops outclass her in other archetype due to their higher health and due to their higher DPS in clearing out tanky defences like Barbarians.</B></I>
		</div>

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>In fact, she is lowest HP splash damaging troop other than both Spirits. Her inability to not be that versatile in the current meta like before makes her at a lower spot.</B></I>
