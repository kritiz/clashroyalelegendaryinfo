			<B><I>His ability to pop-up anywhere in the arena makes him a great chip-damaging card. And he has become a more versatile card since last couple of months appearing in Giant Poison decks forming a new Beatdown-Control Hybrid deck type which is surprisingly pretty strong</B></I>.

		<br>
		<div>
			<B><I>You can play him in a fast, lone cycle form along with Poison or couple it with Battle Ram and Hog Rider as well as Bandit to make a Control-chip decks. He is also strong in 3M pump swarm decks as it can act as a tank for the Muskets and the high DPS swarms</B></I>.

		<div>
			<B><I>Like said above, he is good in Beatdown-Control hybrids when played with P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hound and not only Giant</B></I>.

                                                        <B><I>All of this makes Miner one of the most balanced cards in the game</B></I>.
